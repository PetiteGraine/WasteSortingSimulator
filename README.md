This project is a virtual reality experience developed in Unity, focused on waste sorting as an educational and interactive activity. It explores natural 3D interactions like grabbing, moving, and placing objects in a virtual space, while incorporating spatial cognition aids, visual memory cues, and responsive UI elements such as floating menus, scoring, and contextual feedback. The goal is to optimize the user experience through iterative design, and evaluate its effectiveness using both objective performance metrics and subjective user feedback.
